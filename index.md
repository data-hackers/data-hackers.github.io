a short you can see the original slides [Here](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/v8bnKPAIm9mNkq). the source code for the examples are attached to the github project and available here - https://github.com/data-hackers/data-hackers.github.io

# Hello World

Several other hello world examples that should help you get into the world of ML quickly-ish

## Would you have survived the titanic?
A great introduction to ML workflow using Azure Machine Learning platform, by the end of this example you will create a Model to predict if you would have survived the titanic.

# Toolbox
a short list of interesting tools you should know, this list is by no means comprehensive. but it should be a good start to sample the spectrum of abstractions in the world of ML tools. 

* [Clarifai](https://clarifai.com) - SAAS for building Conv Net classifiers
* [Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/) - multiporpouse high-level abstraction for AI & ML algorithms
* [Rasa AI](https://rasa.ai/) - Open source tools to create SIRI-like conversational AI.
* [H20](https://www.h2o.ai/h2o/) - Open source platform with a nice web UI for implementing ML.
* [Natura](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural) - nodejs NLP and classification library
* [SciKit learn](http://scikit-learn.org) - a popular multiporpouse ML library, great for you first steps.
* [Deeplearn.js](https://deeplearnjs.org) - a JS deeplearning library running in your browser
* [Weka](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) - open source ML tools for beginners, with awesome and easy to use UI. 
* [Keras](https://keras.io/)
* [Microsoft cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/)
* [Google ML Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/)
* [Google NLP Engine](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/)
* [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/)
* [AzureML](https://studio.azureml.net/) - a very impressive ML tools from microsoft, very simple, and rather powerful
* [Amazon AWS ML](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-ai/)
* [Mahout](http://mahout.apache.org/) - a variety of ML algorithms implemented over spark.
* [Word2Vec as a service](http://word2vecapi.com/) - if you dont know what word2vec is [read this](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec)

# Snippets & Recipes

for a great collection of snippets and recipes, I would recommend checking out [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/), and especially their [kernel archive](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels) which contains some great leads on how to handle different datasets and problems

for example
